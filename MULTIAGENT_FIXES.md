# Multi-Agent System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ResultMessage Parsing Error
**Problem**: The SDK was expecting a `cost_usd` field that wasn't always present in the CLI response.
**Fix**: Updated `/src/claude_code_sdk/_internal/client.py` to handle missing fields with defaults:
```python
cost = data.get("cost_usd", data.get("cost", 0.0))
```

### 2. Async/Await Handling  
**Problem**: The agent's `process_task` method could hang waiting for API responses.
**Fix**: Added message counting and early termination to prevent hanging:
```python
if message_count >= 5:
    break
```

### 3. Error Handling
**Problem**: Exceptions during API calls weren't being handled gracefully.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling with descriptive error messages.

### 4. Agent Configuration
**Problem**: Agents were making too many API calls with inappropriate settings.
**Fix**: Updated ClaudeCodeOptions to use:
- Fast model: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- Single turn: `max_turns=1`
- Bypass permissions: `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"`

## New Features Added

### 1. Simulated Demo Mode
Created `simple_multiagent_demo.py` that simulates agent responses without API calls:
- Shows the full system architecture
- Demonstrates task routing and collaboration
- No API costs or rate limits

### 2. Improved Runner Script
Created `run_multiagent_demo_fixed.py` with three modes:
- `--mode simulated`: No API calls, full demo
- `--mode basic`: Full demo with actual Claude API
- `--mode custom`: Limited scenario with minimal API calls

### 3. Better Error Messages
Added helpful error messages and tips when API calls fail:
- CLI installation instructions
- Login reminders
- Rate limit warnings

## Usage

To run the multi-agent system:

```bash
# Simulated mode (recommended for testing)
python run_multiagent_demo_fixed.py --mode simulated

# With actual Claude API (requires CLI setup)
python run_multiagent_demo_fixed.py --mode basic

# Limited API calls
python run_multiagent_demo_fixed.py --mode custom
```

## Architecture Overview

The system now includes:
- 44 specialized agents across 8 teams
- Task routing and dependency management
- Inter-team collaboration capabilities
- Performance tracking and metrics
- Simulated and real execution modes

Each agent has:
- Unique skills and specializations
- Claude-powered decision making (in API mode)
- Task history and performance tracking
- Team collaboration abilities
