# My Steps - Multi-turn Function Calling Agent

## Step 1: Initial Analysis
- Reviewed helpful_assistant.py which contains Jupyter console output
- Found code fragments for:
  - Dynamic Environment & Tool Registry classes
  - OpenAI chat agent with async support
  - Function calling/tool registration system
  - Memory management with summarization

## Step 2: Plan
I'll create a complete multi-turn function calling agent by:
1. Extracting and fixing the code from the Jupyter output
2. Creating a proper multi-turn agent with:
   - Environment configuration
   - Tool registry with auto-injection
   - Async OpenAI integration
   - Multi-turn conversation support
   - Function calling capabilities
   - Memory management
3. Adding example tools and demo usage

## Step 3: Implementation
Created multi_turn_agent.py with:
- Complete Environment class with dynamic attributes
- ToolRegistry with automatic environment injection
- ConversationMemory with auto-summarization
- Async chat function with streaming and tool support
- MultiTurnAgent class for stateful conversations
- Example tools: hello, calculate, get_datetime, remember, recall
- Demo functions for testing

## Step 4: Creating Advanced Examples
Created advanced_agent_examples.py with:
- Advanced tools: weather, TODO manager, code execution, knowledge search, charts
- Specialized agents: ResearchAgent, CodeAssistant, PersonalAssistant
- Complex demos: research, coding, personal assistant, multi-agent collaboration
- Stateful conversation tracking

## Step 5: Claude Max Integration
Created claude_max_agent.py with:
- Tools for delegating complex tasks to claude_max CLI
- Problem decomposition capabilities
- Code generation with detailed explanations
- Deep research functionality
- Code review and improvement
- Subtask tracking across conversations

## Step 6: Testing
Created test_multi_turn_agent.py with:
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Environment and tool registry tests
- Memory management tests
- Agent conversation flow tests
- Tool execution and error handling tests
- Integration tests for built-in tools

## Summary
Successfully created a complete multi-turn function calling agent system with:
1. Core agent framework (multi_turn_agent.py)
2. Advanced usage examples (advanced_agent_examples.py)
3. Claude Max integration (claude_max_agent.py)
4. Comprehensive test suite (test_multi_turn_agent.py)

The agent supports:
- Multi-turn conversations with memory
- Dynamic tool registration and execution
- Streaming responses
- Automatic context summarization
- Environment-based configuration
- Complex task delegation to claude_max
- Extensive error handling
